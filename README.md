# Warrencrawl
First person dungeon crawler engine made in Unity.

The intent is to make a framework in Unity for creating dungeon crawler games down the line. I'm especially interested in developing it for the Dungeon Crawler Jam on Itch (https://itch.io/jam/dcjam2022). The hope is to continue learning about what goes in to a dungeon crawler, and a game in general, as this open ended framework is worked on over time.
